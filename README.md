# Drowsiness_Detection_System
The repo consists the code for computer vision project(detection of eye)

### Dataset: 

Reffered to a dataset in kaggle

### Description:

• Created end to end computer vision project. Drowsiness detection system which can be used to detect if the eye is closed or open

• This system can be helpful to cab drivers which may prevent both customers and the drivers from accident as one can use this system with an alert in their vehicles/cabs

• Used MobileNet, a light weight transformer model; as my base model and then built my final model on top of it with a Dense layer

• Achieved about 99% accuracy on training data and 100% on test data 

• Saved the model so that the saved  model can be used while hosting the project onto the web

• Created the webapp using streamlit and using ngrok to host the model on to the web
